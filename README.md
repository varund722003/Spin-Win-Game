# Spin-Win-Game
Spin and Win 
The wheel stops at a particular angle and whatever the pin points at is what the other 
persons win.
In this game, I have used Phaser(framework) which provides rough skeleton for building
the game.

Scene objects has three functions: 
1. Loading of scene 
2. Creation of scene
3. Continuous motion in the game
